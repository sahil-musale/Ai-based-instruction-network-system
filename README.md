# Ai-based-instruction-network-system
This project is an AI‑based Network Intrusion Detection System that uses machine learning to spot suspicious network activity in real time. It applies a Random Forest classifier to separate normal traffic from attacks, supports simulation with synthetic data for learning, and can be scaled to real datasets like CIC‑IDS2017.
